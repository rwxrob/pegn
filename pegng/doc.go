/*

Package pegng is a library of language elements (Scan/Parse/Read) functions that cover all of the syntax of the pegn language itself as well as a number of other commonly used elements. The hope is that rather than writing yet-another-parser the most common used classes, tokens, and rules can be contained here from which to build other grammars, sometimes programmatically, sometimes not.
